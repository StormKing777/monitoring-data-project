# Observability Suite: Metrics & Monitoring

## Project Summary
This project is about **Monitoring**. I used **Prometheus** to collect data from my servers and **Grafana** to turn that data into beautiful charts and graphs so I can see if the system is happy or sad.

* **Languages Used:** SQL (for data queries).
* **Environments Used:** Linux, Kubernetes.
* **Technologies Used:** Prometheus, Grafana, MySQL.

## 🛠️ Implementation Steps
1. **Prometheus Setup:** Connected Prometheus to my applications to start "scraping" metrics like CPU and Memory usage.
2. **Data Visuals:** Built a **Grafana Dashboard** with colorful graphs.
3. **Alerting:** Set up an alert that sends a message if the server gets too hot or too slow.
